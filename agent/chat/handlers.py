"""Telegram message handlers for the voxnix agent chat layer.

Responsibilities:
  - Extract the Telegram chat_id as the owner identity (trust model anchor)
  - Dispatch text messages to the PydanticAI agent
  - Maintain per-chat conversation history via ConversationStore
  - Split long agent responses into Telegram-sized chunks
  - Handle errors gracefully — users never see raw tracebacks

Architecture decisions reflected here:
  - chat_id IS the user identity — no separate auth system (see docs/architecture.md § Trust Model)
  - agent.run() is called with owner=str(chat_id), which flows into VoxnixDeps
  - Conversation history is stored in-memory per chat_id with TTL expiry and turn limits.
    The store lives for the process lifetime — lost on restart, which is acceptable for
    infrastructure commands. See #48 and #62.
  - The handler is the boundary between Telegram and the agent — it owns error handling
  - Typing action is sent before the agent runs so the user sees immediate feedback

See docs/architecture.md § Chat Integration Layer and § Trust Model.
